This repository contains the codebase for the research project titled "Efficiency and Safety of Automated Label Cleaning on Multimodal Retinal Images," published in npj Digital Medicine. The primary objective of this project is to fine-tune the RETFound model to evaluate its performance on multimodal retinal images.

# Abstract
Label noise is a common and important issue that would affect the modelâ€™s performance in artificial intelligence. This study assessed the effectiveness and potential risks of automated label cleaning using an open-source framework, Cleanlab, in multi-category datasets of fundus photography and optical coherence tomography, with intentionally introduced label noise ranging from 0% to 70%. After 6 cycles of automatic cleaning, significant improvements are achieved in label accuracies (3.4%-62.9%) and dataset quality scores (DQS, 5.1%-74.4%). The majority (86.6% to 97.5%) of label errors were accurately modified, with minimal missed (0.5%-2.8%) or misclassified (0.4%-10.6%). The classification accuracy of RETFound significantly improved by 0.3%-52.9% trained with the datasets after cleaning. We also developed a DQS-guided cleaning strategy to mitigate over-cleaning. Furthermore, external validation on EyePACS and APTOS-2019 datasets boosted label accuracy by 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively. This approach automates label correction, enhances dataset reliability, and strengthens model performance efficiently and safely.
